#### Description of the file/ folder structure of this project ####


# general advice:
- every study has a file named 00_main_document. This is the main file for each study that needs to run and accesses all other files
- after you run the study the outputs/ result summaries are computed in the respective R codes 
- you will have to set your workingdirectories and some of the paths in each main R code as adviced in the code
- please don't change the folder stucture of this project 

# Files in the main folder of this project:
- R codes in the main folder of this project (eg.: IV_functions.R or functions.R)
are generally utilized in the simulation and the application case stud and are not specific 
- all R codes in the folders simulationA, simulationB or application_casestudy are specific to this part of the research

Folder: simulationA and simulationB
- Folders simulationA and simultionB contain all relevant R codes to run the simulation explained in Section 3 of the paper
- this includes the R codes for the results plots
- in the folder simulationA additionally, the R codes for the small simulation study on the performance of the Abrahamowicz method outlined in Appendix 5 can be found 


Folder: appliction_casestudy
- This folder contains all R codes needed to run the application case study outlined in Section 4
- data for this application study cannot be provided but the code will help to frther understand the models used for the causal effect estimation
